Revision history for RPi-GPIOExpander-MCP23017

1.02    2019-10-23
        - merged PR from Mohammad S. Anwar that added a missed file in
          MANIFEST
        - moved test run variables to BEGIN block
        - updated pod-coverage testing

1.01    2019-10-19
        - correct typo in variable assignment in POD's SYNOPSIS (closes #2)
        - added extra check in all test files to ensure that an extra env var
          (RPI_SUBMODULE_TESTING) is set, as we literally only want
          RPi::WiringPi's test platform executing the entire test suite (work
          on stevieb9/rpi-wiringpi#159)

1.00    2018-06-15
        - added check in Makefile.PL for linux/i2c.h. CPAN Testers was breaking
          on non-i2c-enabled systems

0.01    2018-06-07
        - initial public release
        - most core registers available
        - ability to change a single pin, a pin bank, or all pins at once
        - read(), write(), mode(), pullup() methods available for single pins,
          a pin bank and all pins
        - exposed register() and register_bits(), but these are more-or-less
          hidden in documentation and we advise they shouldn't really be used;
          they are a convenience for those who know how to understand IC
          registers
        - 5000+ tests
